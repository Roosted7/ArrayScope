# The queue — what to do next

**This is the only active queue.** If any other document claims to order
current work, that document is stale — fix it to point here.
[`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) says *why* this order serves the mission;
this file says *what, in what order, and when it counts as done*.

**Rules for this file** (they exist because the last three queues drowned):

1. Update rows **in place**. When a step lands, move its row to *Done* below
   with one line of result + a link to the evidence. Never append status
   blockquotes or execution logs here — those go in the commit message, a
   dossier under [`redesign/`](redesign/), or a dated review.
2. Every step names its **exit gate in the ring that can actually see the
   failure** ([testing/README.md](testing/README.md)). "Code exists" and
   "offscreen suite green" are not completion.
3. A rejected/reverted attempt gets a [`graveyard.md`](graveyard.md) row in
   the reverting commit.
4. Re-order only with a stated reason in the commit message.

## Now (2026-07-16, in order)

| # | Step | Exit gate |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Performance-bars program on the engine** (parked — Thomas 2026-07-17: act only on true stalls/no-progress, never on merely-slow). The bars (below) are the product promise. One measured cause at a time, before/after real-Wayland harness evidence per commit; a step that regresses a bar is reverted and buried in the graveyard. | Bars trend green in `profile_montage_workflow` on real Wayland, both backends (PyQtGraph at 2× allowance) |
| 2 | **G6 — GPU histogram/levels.** Per-chunk summaries over the chunk store with the ADR 0056 coverage frontier; GPU LOD generation from resident chunks. | Levels/histogram converge from chunk summaries; no GUI-thread aggregation; real-GL gate |
| 3 | **Renderer protocol + wgpu Experiment A.** Formalize the backend-neutral semantic command table ([tensor-engine-endpoint](proposals/tensor-engine-endpoint.md)); wgpu-py vertical slice (real QRenderWidget; test `present_method` screen vs bitmap on Wayland). QRhiWidget+native runtime is the recorded production candidate. | Command table maps 1:1 onto existing seams; Experiment A renders the montage scenario on real Wayland |
| 4 | **G7 — compressed transport.** Codec ladder, measured topology; ZFP-class first. After G6. | Measured end-to-end win on real data |

## Performance bars (commitments, not history — restored from R2/R4/R8D)

- GUI callbacks < **50 ms** always; event-loop heartbeat gap ≤ **16 ms**
  during fills and scrub; warm scrub input ≤ **15 ms**; settled-idle CPU 0%.
- **#1 throughput target:** fast montage FFT index scroll ~4 fps → toward
  the ~17 fps scalar rate (2026-07-09 measurement, realistic human scroll).
- Benchmark deltas stay within ±10% of the frozen baseline unless a step
  improves them. PyQtGraph gets 2× the VisPy allowance (it targets
  headless/remote use); both backends stay first-class for correctness.

## Standing lane — test hardening & debt (parallel-safe, any order)

- **Re-rank in-flight coverage waves when the camera re-anchors.** A
  montage entered under a preserved USER camera that is then fitted
  (programmatic pulse or AUTO replay) re-focuses only newly planned waves;
  kernel tasks already submitted keep their stale scheduling_rank, so the
  fill finishes in the old order (2026-07-17 raw-fill sheets: anchor at
  tile ~92 of 272). Contract: priority re-targets on every view change —
  including work already queued. Owner: kernel re-rank on
  tile-priority-context change, or supersede-and-resubmit of unstarted
  coverage tasks at retarget.
Safe to pick up alongside the numbered queue; each is self-contained.

- **complex64 PyQtGraph presentation deadlock** (deterministic; strict xfail
  in the stress matrix).
- **PyQtGraph physical readback oracle** — the framebuffer-to-CPU oracle
  (Done, 2026-07-17) covers the VisPy canvas only; PyQtGraph scalar
  levels/LUT run in the Qt raster path and still have no pixels-vs-CPU gate.
- **Remove the `montage_key_batch_fallbacks` runtime guard** once the
  consolidated key owner is proven in the field. 2026-07-17: derivation is
  consolidated — every layout has one owner
  (`_display_tile_key_from_parts`/`_request_key_from_parts`/
  `_view_state_key_with_slices` in `evaluator.py`; the batch's slow path *is*
  `display_tile_key`) and parity + fallback are pinned in
  `tests/operations/test_cache.py`. The runtime guard and counter stay until
  a release cycle shows the counter at zero.
- **Audit `_resident_source_matches_expected(source, None) → True`**
  (controller-side expected-source coverage during session switches).

## Done (most recent first — one line each, evidence linked)

- 2026-07-17 — **Output-driven journey matrix delivered** (standing lane):
  `{cold fill, zoom-in, zoom-out, scroll shuffle, index scroll}` × both
  backends now records gesture-scoped JSONL + screenshot timelines and gates
  phase ordering, bounded priority-ordered commits, camera-demand freshness,
  first-pixel latency, and post-coverage LOD convergence. Every oracle has a
  fault injection; `trace_verify` independently rejects phase-2 submission
  during coverage. The first real-Wayland run is intentionally red and
  mechanically exposes the open 2026-07-17/18 defects (artifact:
  `tests/artifacts/journey-matrix-2026-07-17-v3/`). Contract and pre-merge
  command: [testing/README.md](testing/README.md#journey-matrix-trajectory-gate).
- 2026-07-17 — **Framebuffer-to-CPU reference oracle + fault injection**
  (standing lane): `tests/oracles/framebuffer_reference.py` compares the
  live VisPy framebuffer per required tile against the CPU shader mirror;
  real-GL audit `tests/gpu_interaction/test_framebuffer_cpu_reference.py`
  (wrong uniform / stale atlas page / swapped tile each fail the oracle,
  restore turns it green) + default-ring smoke
  `tests/ui/test_framebuffer_cpu_reference.py`. Evidence: full
  `tests/gpu_interaction` ring 16/16 green on real Wayland 2026-07-17 —
  which also closes the "4 pre-existing P9-era baseline failures" row: none
  reproduce post-G5.
- 2026-07-17 — **ImageViewShell duplication lane closed**
  (`b657bb5d..d71d4c8e`): the shell is now the single owner of ROI/
  interaction emphasis, the tiled-commit skeleton, and tiled-layer queries;
  PyQtGraph tile mechanics moved to `ImageView2D` behind declared backend
  hooks; VisPy's seven override+mirror methods and its duplicate
  hover/selection owners deleted. Behavior-preserving refactor gated on
  ring 1 (full offscreen suite green); no ring 3–4 run — no rendering
  behavior change intended.
- 2026-07-17 — **`target_satisfied_retained` emitted in production** (standing
  lane): the lifecycle emits it once per target requirement closed by a
  retained compatible payload (retarget/ack/confirm edges + the settled
  noop-commit re-affirmation in `frame_effects`); `trace_verify` re-judges
  the edge with the production settlement rule (fallback needs strictly finer
  level); `TOLERATED_INVARIANTS` is empty — the strongest invariant
  (`final_required_target_acknowledged`) is enforced in the stress matrix,
  which passed 5/5 rows serially. Gates: `tests/core/test_trace.py`
  (`*retained_satisfaction*`, red-first).

- 2026-07-17 — **G5 merged to main** (`661b6ba5`): canonical source-grid page
  route, reducer families, page cache, both-backend consumers, legacy
  whole-plane ownership deleted with a resurrection guard; the progressive
  presentation contract (docs/architecture/rendering.md) is enforced at the
  commit gate AND the scheduler (coverage before refinement, plan-wide);
  live evidence: PyQtGraph raw 272/272 in ~11.4 s coverage-then-refine,
  churn ring green, zero refinement-during-pass commits on both backends
  (tests/artifacts/g5-coverage-first-*-2026-07-17). Red and owned by the
  perf-bars program: 50 ms GUI-callback, VisPy 4.5 s draw settle.

- 2026-07-16 — **Churn-convergence stall net closed** (members 4+5 of the
  deferred-stage lost-wakeup family: stale-render-generation discard/resubmit
  livelock in stage-plan/stage-value completions; exact-pass candidacy
  starvation for non-exact payloads at the target level). Commit chain and
  stage-plan callbacks now emit loud bail/decision trace events; the live
  churn scenario converges 3/3 in ~23 s and its xfail is removed. Dossier:
  [stale-empty-tiles-2026-07-16](redesign/stale-empty-tiles-2026-07-16.md).
- 2026-07-16 — PyQtGraph identity-rejected upserts made loud (`6f95ce70`).
- 2026-07-16 — Session-148 identity-aliasing follow-ups: canonical full
  ranges, per-tile ack-vs-target coverage, re-commit backoff, trace_verify
  invariant (`37979222`; dossier
  [stale-empty-tiles-2026-07-16](redesign/stale-empty-tiles-2026-07-16.md)).
- 2026-07-16 — Orange floor tiles (per-session preview metadata vs
  persistent pyramid cache) + three deferred-stage lost-wakeups (`18a207fb`).
- 2026-07-16 — Identity-aliasing starvation stall root-caused and fixed
  (`dff723b4`).
- 2026-07-16 — Montage scroll-direction GPU warming; retained-slice
  staleness fixed at the rung-label owner (dossier
  [slice-retention-staleness-2026-07-16](redesign/slice-retention-staleness-2026-07-16.md)).
- 2026-07-15 — G1–G5 slice 1 of the GPU engine landed and real-GL verified;
  physical presentation truth standing invariant; see
  [proposals/gpu-engine-plan.md](proposals/gpu-engine-plan.md) status and
  the [continuation brief](proposals/gpu-port-continuation.md).
- 2026-07-14 — V0–V4 visible-truth program closed and merged; execution
  record in
  [redesign/archive/v-program-execution-record-2026-07.md](redesign/archive/v-program-execution-record-2026-07.md).
- 2026-07-14/15 — P1–P9 measured performance program; log in
  [redesign/archive/p-program-log-2026-07.md](redesign/archive/p-program-log-2026-07.md);
  its open cause (per-step 60-slot rebind) is solved structurally by the
  GPU engine's chunked residency.
