# Architecture

Main rule: Qt collects intent and displays results; Qt widgets are not the
source of array-view state.

## Ownership

- `arrayscope.core.ViewState`: authoritative current view of the derived array: shape, image
  axes, profile axis, slice indices, channel, scale, and per-axis flags.
- `arrayscope.display.slice_engine`: converts `data + ViewState` into display-ready images and
  lines.
- `arrayscope.operations.pipeline`: immutable NumPy operations plus shape prediction.
- `arrayscope.operations.coordinator`: owns the operation document, evaluator, stack edits,
  and materialization.
- `arrayscope.profiles.model` / `arrayscope.profiles.coordinator`: maps image-space marker positions to
  profile view states and line results.
- `arrayscope.core.window_levels`: decides image window/level reuse or auto-level behavior.
- `arrayscope.display.ImageView2D`, `arrayscope.ui`, and `arrayscope.ui.docks`: Qt display and controls only.
- `arrayscope.window.main.ArrayScopeWindow`: wires Qt signals to state changes, then calls `render()`.
- `arrayscope.app.launch`: QApplication creation, multiprocessing launch, and IPython Qt event-loop handling.
- `arrayscope.io`: file loading, dataset selectors, and save workflows.
- `arrayscope.export`: video/frame export workers and UI workflow.

The public package surface is intentionally small: users should prefer
`import arrayscope as asc` followed by `asc(data)`. Internal code should import
concrete submodules rather than relying on package-root re-exports.

## Render Flow

User actions update `ViewState` or the operation coordinator. `render()` then:

1. migrates `ViewState` to the current derived shape;
2. syncs controls from `ViewState`;
3. renders image/profile data through the evaluator;
4. applies view-only axis flips;
5. updates docks, labels, and cache status.

Do not read widget values to reconstruct `ViewState`. Widget state is an output
of render, except transient UI-only state such as dock visibility and histogram
interaction.

## Interdependency Map

When changing `ViewState`, check:

- `arrayscope.display.slice_engine`
- `arrayscope.profiles`
- `arrayscope.operations.evaluator`
- `arrayscope.operations.coordinator`
- `arrayscope.window.render.RenderMixin.render()`
- `arrayscope.export`
- Qt smoke/artifact tests

When changing `slice_engine`, check:

- image display
- profile extraction
- video export
- window-level behavior

When changing `operation_pipeline`, check:

- operation registry and recipes
- operation dock
- evaluator cache keys
- `ViewState.for_shape()`

## Placement Guide

- Axis validation: `arrayscope.core.axis_utils`.
- Pure array transforms: `arrayscope.operations.dim_ops` or `arrayscope.operations.pipeline`.
- Display conversion: `arrayscope.display.slice_engine`.
- Colormap creation: `arrayscope.display.colormaps`.
- Window/level decisions: `arrayscope.core.window_levels`.
- User-action orchestration: `arrayscope.window` mixins or a focused coordinator.
- Qt UI controls: `arrayscope.ui` and `arrayscope.ui.docks`.
